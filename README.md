# Defi_Empire

Welcome to the challenge! In this tutorial, you'll set up an EVM subnet on Avalanche, perfect for starting your DeFi Kingdom clone. We'll guide you through creating and deploying the subnet, and deploying two key contracts: an ERC20 token and a Vault contract. These contracts lay the foundation for your DeFi Kingdom, letting you explore decentralized finance and begin building your own DeFi empire. 

## Steps

1. create avalanche subnet
`avalanche subnet create RUS`

2. deploy avalanche subnet
`avalanche subnet create RUS`

3. configure in metamask

4. interact with ERC20.sol and Vault.sol
